Good morning, Rachel. 
Good morning, Paul. How are you doing? 
Just fine. How about you? 
I'm doing pretty good.
 What a beautiful day.
  You're right. It is a beautiful day.
   Oh, no, Mr. Collins. He is in the office to day.
    Really. He's so angry and rude. 
    I know. I'm always nervous when he's around. Me too.
     Well, I guess it's not such a beautiful day after all. 
     I know. I agree.
